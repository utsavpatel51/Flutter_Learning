# learning03

1.  Updated project03.
2.  Used ListTile. Scrolling is faster compare to Card beacuse less data to load and looks good.
3.  Added PageRoute for Detail page for each character.
4.  Added Like button, currently not storing the data.
5.  Still not sure how to pick good color, so I ended up using random color palette from https://colorsinspo.com/.

#### Home Page
<img src="main.png" width="200" height="400"/>

#### Detail Page
